# ComptonSim
ComptonSim is a Github project aimed at simulating Compton scattering, a phenomenon that occurs when photons interact with charged particles, such as electrons. This project will provide a platform to simulate the behavior of photons as they scatter off of electrons, allowing users to study and visualize the interaction of light with matter.

ComptonSim will use the Monte Carlo method, a popular technique for simulating complex physical systems, to accurately model the behavior of photons and electrons during scattering. The project will be developed using Python, and will include modules for visualizing the simulation results.

With ComptonSim, users can explore the fundamental principles of Compton scattering, including the relationship between the wavelength of the incident photon, the scattering angle, and the energy of the scattered photon. This project will be useful for students and researchers in physics, as well as anyone interested in learning more about the behavior of light and matter.
